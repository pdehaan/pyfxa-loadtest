Usage: locust [OPTIONS] [UserClass ...]

Common options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f LOCUSTFILE, --locustfile LOCUSTFILE
                        Python module to import, e.g. '../other_test.py'.
                        Either a .py file or a package directory. Defaults to
                        'locustfile'
  --config CONFIG       Config file path
  -H HOST, --host HOST  Host to load test in the following format:
                        http://10.21.32.33
  -u NUM_USERS, --users NUM_USERS
                        Peak number of concurrent Locust users. Primarily used
                        together with --headless or --autostart. Can be
                        changed during a test by keyboard inputs w, W (spawn
                        1, 10 users) and s, S (stop 1, 10 users)
  -r SPAWN_RATE, --spawn-rate SPAWN_RATE
                        Rate to spawn users at (users per second). Primarily
                        used together with --headless or --autostart
  -t RUN_TIME, --run-time RUN_TIME
                        Stop after the specified amount of time, e.g. (300s,
                        20m, 3h, 1h30m, etc.). Only used together with
                        --headless or --autostart. Defaults to run forever.
  -l, --list            Show list of possible User classes and exit

Web UI options:
  --web-host WEB_HOST   Host to bind the web interface to. Defaults to '*'
                        (all interfaces)
  --web-port WEB_PORT, -P WEB_PORT
                        Port on which to run web host
  --headless            Disable the web interface, and start the test
                        immediately. Use -u and -t to control user count and
                        run time
  --autostart           Starts the test immediately (without disabling the web
                        UI). Use -u and -t to control user count and run time
  --autoquit AUTOQUIT   Quits Locust entirely, X seconds after the run is
                        finished. Only used together with --autostart. The
                        default is to keep Locust running until you shut it

Master options:
  Options for running a Locust Master node when running Locust distributed. A Master node need Worker nodes that connect to it before it can run load tests.

  --master              Set locust to run in distributed mode with this
                        process as master
  --master-bind-host MASTER_BIND_HOST
                        Interfaces (hostname, ip) that locust master should
                        bind to. Only used when running with --master.
                        Defaults to * (all available interfaces).
  --master-bind-port MASTER_BIND_PORT
                        Port that locust master should bind to. Only used when
                        running with --master. Defaults to 5557.
  --expect-workers EXPECT_WORKERS
                        How many workers master should expect to connect
                        before starting the test (only when
                        --headless/autostart is used).
  --expect-workers-max-wait EXPECT_WORKERS_MAX_WAIT
                        How long should the master wait for workers to connect
                        before giving up. Defaults to wait forever

Worker options:
  Options for running a Locust Worker node when running Locust distributed.
  Only the LOCUSTFILE (-f option) needs to be specified when starting a Worker, since other options such as -u, -r, -t are specified on the Master node.

  --worker              Set locust to run in distributed mode with this
                        process as worker
  --master-host MASTER_NODE_HOST
                        Host or IP address of locust master for distributed
                        load testing. Only used when running with --worker.
                        Defaults to 127.0.0.1.
  --master-port MASTER_NODE_PORT
                        The port to connect to that is used by the locust
                        master for distributed load testing. Only used when
                        running with --worker. Defaults to 5557.

Tag options:
  Locust tasks can be tagged using the @tag decorator. These options let specify which tasks to include or exclude during a test.

  -T [TAG [TAG ...]], --tags [TAG [TAG ...]]
                        List of tags to include in the test, so only tasks
                        with any matching tags will be executed
  -E [TAG [TAG ...]], --exclude-tags [TAG [TAG ...]]
                        List of tags to exclude from the test, so only tasks
                        with no matching tags will be executed

Request statistics options:
  --csv CSV_PREFIX      Store current request stats to files in CSV format.
                        Setting this option will generate three files:
                        [CSV_PREFIX]_stats.csv, [CSV_PREFIX]_stats_history.csv
                        and [CSV_PREFIX]_failures.csv
  --csv-full-history    Store each stats entry in CSV format to
                        _stats_history.csv file. You must also specify the '--
                        csv' argument to enable this.
  --print-stats         Print stats in the console
  --only-summary        Only print the summary stats
  --reset-stats         Reset statistics once spawning has been completed.
                        Should be set on both master and workers when running
                        in distributed mode
  --html HTML_FILE      Store HTML report to file path specified

Logging options:
  --skip-log-setup      Disable Locust's logging setup. Instead, the
                        configuration is provided by the Locust test or Python
                        defaults.
  --loglevel LOGLEVEL, -L LOGLEVEL
                        Choose between DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL.
                        Default is INFO.
  --logfile LOGFILE     Path to log file. If not set, log will go to stderr

Other options:
  --show-task-ratio     Print table of the User classes' task execution ratio.
                        Use this with non-zero --user option if some classes
                        define non-zero fixed_count property.
  --show-task-ratio-json
                        Print json data of the User classes' task execution
                        ratio. Use this with non-zero --user option if some
                        classes define non-zero fixed_count property.
  --version, -V         Show program's version number and exit
  --exit-code-on-error EXIT_CODE_ON_ERROR
                        Sets the process exit code to use when a test result
                        contain any failure or error
  -s STOP_TIMEOUT, --stop-timeout STOP_TIMEOUT
                        Number of seconds to wait for a simulated user to
                        complete any executing task before exiting. Default is
                        to terminate immediately. This parameter only needs to
                        be specified for the master process when running
                        Locust distributed.
  --equal-weights       Use equally distributed task weights, overriding the
                        weights specified in the locustfile.
  --enable-rebalancing  Allow to automatically rebalance users if new workers
                        are added or removed during a test run.

User classes:
  UserClass             Optionally specify which User classes that should be
                        used (available User classes can be listed with -l or
                        --list)
